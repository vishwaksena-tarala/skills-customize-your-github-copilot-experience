# 📘 Assignment: Python Basics

## 🎯 Objective

Practice fundamental Python programming skills by collecting user input, formatting strings, and writing simple arithmetic and conditional logic functions.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ User Input and String Formatting

#### Description
Write a function called `welcome_message()` that interacts with the user and returns a formatted welcome message.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Ask the user for their name, age, and favorite color using `input()`.
- Return a welcome message formatted as:
  `Hello, [name]! You are [age] years old and your favorite color is [color].`
- Example output:
  ```text
  Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old and your favorite color is blue.
  ```

### 🛠️ Arithmetic and Conditionals

#### Description
Write two functions: `add_two_numbers()` to add user-entered numbers and `is_even()` to check whether a number is even.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- `add_two_numbers()`:
  - Ask the user to enter two numbers.
  - Add the numbers together and print the result.
  - Example interaction:
    ```text
    Enter the first number: 3
    Enter the second number: 7
    10
    ```
- `is_even(number)`:
  - Take a single integer argument.
  - Return `True` if the number is even, and `False` if it is odd.
  - Example usage:
    ```python
    print(is_even(4))  # True
    print(is_even(5))  # False
    ```
